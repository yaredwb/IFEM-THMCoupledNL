# IFEM-THMCoupledNL
A solver for thermo-hydro-mechanically (THM) coupled processes in porous media based on the Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) toolbox [IFEM](https://github.com/OPM/IFEM). The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) solved are the momentum, mass and energy balance equations for a three-phase saturated porous medium.

**Note:** This repository is not upto date with the latest version of the IFEM toolbox.
